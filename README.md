# MfM_Assignment
This repository contains some codes for the Course 'Modelling from Measurements'.
The assignment has been divided into three main exercises:
1. Population Data: perform DMD (standard and optimized version) and model discovery on a given dataset.
2. Neural Networks for reaction-diffusion, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky  and Lorenz equations.

### How to use it
The problems have been solved either in MATLAB or in Python. The scripts are all self-consistent and they are able to call the necessary auxiliary files.

- MATLAB: download the entire repository and execute the .m files in the terminal
- Python: Colab notebooks have been written, all the instruction are in the notebook itself.

'matlab' folder is necessary and it may be called by .m scripts (the path has already been added in the code).
