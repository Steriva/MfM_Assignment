# MfM_Assignment
This repository contains some codes for the Course 'Modelling from Measurements'.
The assignment has been divided into three main exercises:
1. Population Data: perform DMD (standard and optimized version) and model discovery.
2. Neural Networks for reaction-diffusion and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations
3. Neural Networks for Lorentz equations

### How to use it
The problems have been solved either in MATLAB or in Python. The scripts are all self-consistent and they are able to call the necessary auxiliary files.

- MATLAB: download the entire repository and execute the .m files in the terminal
- Python: Colab notebooks have been written, all the instruction are in the notebook itself.

'matlab' folder is necessary and it may be called by .m scripts.
