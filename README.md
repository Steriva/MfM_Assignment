# MfM_Assignment
This repository contains the codes for the Homework Assignment of the course 'Modelling from Measurements', provided by professor N. Kutz at Politecnico di Milano.

The assignment has been divided into two main exercises:
1. Population Data: perform DMD (standard and optimized version) and model discovery (SINDy) on a given dataset.
2. Neural Networks for Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, Reaction-Diffusion and Lorenz equations.

Moreover, an extra-code on the application of SYNDy to the Point Kinetics equations is present.

### How to use it
The problems have been solved either in MATLAB or in Python. The scripts are all self-consistent and they are able to call the necessary auxiliary files.

- MATLAB: download the entire repository and execute the .m files in the terminal
- Python: Colab notebooks have been written, all the instruction are in the notebook itself.

'matlab' folder is necessary and it may be called by .m scripts (the path has already been added in the code).

### Notes
In case of problems, contact stefano.riva@polimi.it.
